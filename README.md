# Predicting the Best Shooters in the NBA using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Abstract
This research focuses on predicting the best shooters in the NBA using machine learning algorithms applied to statistical information from the 2021-2022 NBA playoffs. The dataset comprises 29 attributes and 217 instances, covering various player performance metrics. Utilizing the Weka tool, classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, J48, Random Forest, SMO, K-nearest neighbor, and Random Tree are employed. Additionally, clustering algorithms, including Simple k-means, Make Density Based Clustering, Farthest First, and Filtered Clusterer, aim to group players based on their shooting abilities. The study aims to contribute to the prediction of skilled shooters using diverse machine learning approaches, facilitating valuable insights for future research.
